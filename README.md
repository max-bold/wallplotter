# wallplotter

This project is aimed at creating a structurally extremely simple, but at the same time sufficiently accurate and efficient cable plotter for applying graphic images to vertical surfaces.

We will try to take all the experience of developing such projects as:
- [Polargraph](https://www.polargraph.co.uk/)
- [V-Plotter](https://www.revout.de/vplotter/)

At the same time, by supplementing these solutions with a developed mathematical apparatus that allows taking into account:
- Stretching and deflection of cables
- Different accelerations when moving in different directions
- Friction and weight of the tool holder
