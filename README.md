# wallplotter

This project is aimed at creating a structurally extremely simple, but at the same time sufficiently accurate and efficient cable plotter for applying graphic images to vertical surfaces.

We will try to take all the experience of developing such projects as:
- [Polargraph](https://www.polargraph.co.uk/)
- [V-Plotter](https://www.revout.de/vplotter/)

At the same time, by supplementing these solutions with a developed mathematical apparatus that allows taking into account:
- Stretching and deflection of cables
- Different accelerations when moving in different directions
- Friction and weight of the tool holder
- Using 2-4 steppers
- Automatic binding to the working plane and determination of parameters by solving a system of nonlinear equations

Also, within the  project, we will try to develop a number of designs that allow us to realize the inherent capabilities and build our own cable plotter and develop software to manage it. 

The main tasks of the software should be:
- Automatic (semi-automatic) binding of the working plane
- Definition and setting of image application (printing) parameters
- Image layout on the working plane
- Pre-processing of images for application
